description: Analyzes a video file with Google Gemini and returns a structured markdown report covering top-level summary, scene-by-scene breakdown, audio transcript (or honest "silent" note), visual details, and key timestamped moments. Strong anti-hallucination guardrails — will not invent narrators, voiceovers, or speaker names. Use when you need to understand what actually happens in a video.

# Analyze Video

Analyze a video file with Gemini and return a structured markdown report.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `google-genai` installed globally (any Python the shell finds via `python3` works — verified working at version 1.64.0)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` set in the user's shell environment (e.g. exported in `~/.zshrc`)

## Steps

1. Parse the arguments from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - **video path** (required) — path to the video file
   - **--prompt** (optional) — custom analysis prompt; defaults to a structured-report prompt with anti-hallucination rules
   - **--fps** (optional) — custom frame sampling rate (useful for catching sub-second cuts in fast-paced footage)
   - **--model** (optional) — Gemini model ID; defaults to `gemini-3-flash-preview` (free tier). Use `--model gemini-3.1-pro-preview` for the most capable Pro model (requires a billing-enabled key, no free tier).

2. Verify the video file exists at the given path. If not, report the error and stop.

3. Run the analysis script using the absolute path to its install location:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/video-analyzer/scripts/analyze_video.py $ARGUMENTS
```

4. The script will:
   - Upload the video — inline for files ≤18MB, Files API for larger files (with up-to-300s polling for ACTIVE state)
   - Send the prompt to Gemini with the video attached
   - Print the full markdown report to stdout (info/progress lines go to stderr)

5. Capture stdout and present the report to the user.

6. If the script exits with an error, help the user troubleshoot:
   - **Missing API key**: confirm `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY` is non-empty in their shell. If it's only in `~/.zshrc`, they may need to start a new terminal or `source ~/.zshrc`.
   - **Unsupported format**: must be one of mp4, mov, avi, webm, mpeg, mpg, wmv, 3gpp, 3gp, flv
   - **Upload timeout**: large file or slow connection — retry, or use a shorter clip
   - **Model error / 404**: try a different model with `--model gemini-3.1-pro-preview`

## Output

A markdown report printed to stdout with these sections:

- **Top-Level Summary** — 2-3 sentence overview of what actually happens
- **Scene-by-Scene Breakdown** — `MM:SS` timestamps for each cut/scene with on-screen content, actions, and verbatim text
- **Audio** — verbatim transcript with timestamps, OR an honest "no audio / silent / ambient only" note (the prompt explicitly forbids inventing narrators)
- **Visual Details** — on-screen text, UI elements, products, branding, people
- **Key Moments** — 3-7 timestamped highlights a viewer would remember
